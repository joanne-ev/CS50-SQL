# üõåüèΩ Bed and Breakfast

## Problem to Solve

A Bed and Breakfast (‚ÄúBnB‚Äù for short!) is a short-term place one might stay and pay the owner for the service, similar to a hotel. Over the past few years, AirBnB has allowed most anyone to rent out their place, whether it‚Äôs a home, a cute cottage, or even a treehouse.

You‚Äôre a data analyst for the City of Boston and you‚Äôre interested in discovering how the rise of AirBnB has changed the local tourist scene. You‚Äôve even compiled a database, bnb.db, filled with data directly from AirBnB. In `bnb.db`, whip up a few views that will paint a clearer picture of AirBnB‚Äôs influence on the city of Boston.

## Distribution Code

For this problem, you‚Äôll need to download `bnb.db`, along with a few `.sql` files in which you‚Äôll write your queries.

```zsh
wget https://cdn.cs50.net/sql/2024/x/psets/4/bnb.zip
```

## Schema

<p align="center">
	<img src="bnb-entity-relationship.png" alt="bnb entity relationship" width="300"/>
</p>

Within `bnb.db`, you‚Äôll find three tables that implement the relationships described in the ER diagram above.

### `listings` table

- `id`, which is the ID of the listing.
- `property_type`, which is the type of the listing (e.g., ‚ÄúEntire rental unit‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrivate room in rental unit‚Äù, etc.).
- `host_name`, which is the AirBnB username of the listing‚Äôs host.
- `accommodates`, which is the listing‚Äôs maximum number of occupants.
- `bedrooms`, which is the listing‚Äôs number of bedrooms.
- `description`, which is the description of the listing on AirBnB.

### `reviews` table

- `id`, which is the ID of the review.
- `listing_id`, which is the ID of the listing which received the review.
- `date`, which is the date the review was posted.
- `reviewer_name`, which is the AirBnB username of the reviewer.
- `comments`, which is the content of the review.

### `availabilities` table

- `id`, which is the ID of the availability.
- `listing_id`, which is the listing ID associated with the availability.
- `date`, which is the date of the availability.
- `available`, which is whether the date is still available to be booked (TRUE or FALSE).
- `price`, which is the price of staying on the given date.

## Specification

In each of the corresponding `.sql` files, write a SQL statement to create each of the following views of the data in `bnb.db`. Note that, while views can be created from other views, each of your views should stand alone (i.e., not rely on a prior view).

### No Descriptions

You might notice that when running

```sql
SELECT * FROM "listings" LIMIT 5;
```

the results look quite wonky! The description column contains descriptions with many line breaks, each of which are printed to your terminal.

In `no_descriptions.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `no_descriptions` that includes all of the columns in the listings table except for description.

### One-Bedrooms

In `one_bedrooms.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `one_bedrooms`. This view should contain all listings that have exactly one bedroom. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the id of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `accommodates`, from the `listings` table.

### Available

In `available.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `available`. This view should contain all dates that are available at all listings. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the id of the `listing` from the listings table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `date`, from the `availabilities` table, which is the date of the availability.

### Frequently Reviewed

In `frequently_reviewed.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `frequently_reviewed`. This view should contain the 100 most frequently reviewed listings, sorted from most- to least-frequently reviewed. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the id of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `reviews`, which is the number of reviews the listing has received.

If any two listings have the same number of `reviews`, sort by `property_type` (in alphabetical order), followed by `host_name` (in alphabetical order).

### June Vacancies

In `june_vacancies.sql`, write a SQL statement to create a view named `june_vacancies`. This view should contain all listings and the number of days in June of 2023 that they remained vacant. Ensure the view contains the following columns:

- `id`, which is the id of the listing from the `listings` table.
- `property_type`, from the `listings` table.
- `host_name`, from the `listings` table.
- `days_vacant`, which is the number of days in June of 2023, that the given listing was marked as available.

## How to Test

While check50 is available for this problem, you‚Äôre encouraged to also test your code on your own. You might try queries like the below:

- How many listings are there in total? Use your `no_descriptions` view to find that there are 3,973.
- How many one-bedroom listings are there? And how many can accommodate at least 4 guests? Use your `one_bedrooms` view to find that of the 1,228 one-bedrooms, 222 of them can accommodate your group of 4.
- How many listings have availability for December 31st, 2023 (i.e., ‚Äú2023-12-31‚Äù)? Use your `available` view to find that there are 2,251. How many of those are available on any type of boat? You should find that there are 7. Enjoy your New Year‚Äôs Eve afloat!
- How many reviews does the most frequently reviewed property have? And who is the host of that property? Use your `frequently_reviewed` view to find that Tiffany‚Äôs property has 860 reviews.
- How many listings were available in June 2023? Use your `june_vacancies` view to find that there were 1,895 vacancies.
